Introduction
=============
Wireless communication systems have experienced substantial revolutionary progress over the past years. With the rapid progress of 3GPP 5G phase 2 standardization and forthcoming commercial deployment of 5G system many researchers from academia and industry have started envisioning what 6G will be [@zhang_towards_2020]. AI improves network management in different aspects including monitoring, processing, and decision-making. Machine learning (ML) as a form of AI involves teaching the machines by making the data-driven decision (thinking) to perform tasks and functionalities (acting) independently without human intervention. ML has great potential in supporting big data analytics, efficient parameter estimation, and interactive decision-making [@piran_learning-driven_2019]. In this paper, we deal with unsupervised machine learning techniques as potential solutions to upcoming 6G wireless communications challenges.

 The application of unsupervised machine learning techniques in 6G wireless communication systems has been the subject that attracts interest in recent years. A search in the Scopus abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature shows that there are 5 conference papers and 36 journal papers related to approaching 6G wireless communications with unsupervised machine learning from 2019 to present. Recent years have seen an increased interest in unsupervised machine learning as potential solution to upcoming 6G wireless communications challenges (Figure \@ref(fig:reviewGraph))

Figure \@ref(fig:unsupervisedML) displays a typical procedure of unsupervised machine learning. Unsupervised machine learning aims to learn a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data [@sun_application_2019]. Given the lack of sample data-label pairs, there is no standard approach to evaluating the accuracy of unsupervised learning algorithms, which is the main difference compared to its supervised learning aided counterpart [@wang_thirty_2020].

The remainder of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we present some of the emerging new 6G applications and services and the role of unsupervised machine learning. Finally, Section III concludes this review paper with some remarks.

# Brief description of unsupervised learning algorithms

Unsupervised learning algorithms are given a set of unlabeled input to correctly infer the output. These techniques are usually used for clustering and aggregation. Typical unsupervised algorithms include K-means, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), hidden Markov model (HMM), Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), fuzzy C-means, Auto Encoders (AEs) etc. Also, unsupervised machine learning can be applied to enhance the performance of different Deep Learning (DL) algorithms including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Residual Network (ResNets), Inception CNN and Long short-term memory (LSTM) [@zhang_towards_2020]

- K-means: It is a widely used method for the classification of a set of unlabeled data into different clusters. K represents the number of desired clusters. The objective function of k-means represents the distance between data and associated centroids. K-means tend to assign each data-point to a cluster with the centroid that is nearest to it, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:kMeans). The process of updating centroids based on an assigned data point will be repeated until no point or centroid changes. The selection of K has a great impact on the performance of the algorithm.

```

- Self-organizing map: SOM is often used for dimensionality reduction and data clustering. SOM contains one input layer and one map layer. Each layer includes many neurons and each neuron has a weight vector. During the training process, SOM can build and reorganize the map. Unlike conventional NNs that apply error correction learning, SOMs use an unsupervised competitive learning approach. After training, a new input vector is classified into a cluster based on the winning neuron on the map. The techniques have been successfully used in various pattern recognition tasks.
- Hidden Markov model: The approach can be used to model a system by a Markov process with unknown parameters. The main challenge is to determine the hidden parameters from known parameters. Markov models are widely used in randomly dynamic scenarios with memoryless property, which means the conditional probability distribution of future states only depends on the current state. The parameters of HMM can be trained in a supervised or unsupervised way. The HMM can be used to represent non-stationary sequences, allowing the system to change over time with different output probability distributions of each state.
- Autoencoders: Autoencoders are simple learning circuits which aim to transform inputs into outputs with the least possible amount of distortion. Autoencoders, particularly in the form of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMS), are stacked and trained bottom-up in an unsupervised fashion, followed by a supervised learning phase to train the top layer and fine-tune the entire architecture. The bottom-up phase is agnostic with respect to the final task and, thus, can be used in transfer learning approaches. These deep architectures have been shown to lead to state-of-the-art results on a number of challenging classification and regression problems [@baldi_autoencoders_2012]. Based on the basic auto-encoder structure, the advanced denoising autoencoder (DAE) has been developed to reconstruct the input from a noisy version of input data. By using multiple layers of autoencoders, stacked autoencoders (SAE) can be trained in series to gradually compress the input information [@zhang_towards_2020]. Figure \@ref(fig:autoencoder) displays the architecture of a traditional autoencoder model.

# 6G APPLICATIONS AND UNSUPERVISED LEARNING 

As its precursor 5G, 6G will support also enhanced Mobile Broadband communications (eMBB), Ultrareliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) and massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC), but with enhanced capabilities. The 6G eMBB services are expected to be more context aware and to adapt more flexibly to the network context, physical environment context and social network context. Enhanced broadband experience will consider network congestion and topology, physical location and mobility, and social status and moods. 6G will support URLLC in case of extreme and emergency situations with many uncertainties. The lower latency and higher reliability must be provided with content awareness for ultra-dense environments, with temporary and spatially changing network topologies and traffic models. The ultra-high heterogeneity and density of connected devices require reconsidering of key performance indicators of mMTC for latency, jitter, compatibility, energy efficiency, complexity, signaling overhead etc [@pencheva_toward_2020].

For future 6G networks, coverage, capacity and power control optimization is critical to provide universal network services to various use cases [@zhang_towards_2020]. To achieve optimal coverage by tuning cluster size and antenna parameters, authors in [@debono_cellular_2005] proposed a two-layered SOM based approach. Also, in [@lee_resource_2018], [@eisen_optimal_2020]  optimal resource allocation and interference minimization is approached using an unsupervised DNN model and a random edge graph neural network trained using unsupervised model-free, primal-dual learning method, respectively. In [@cui_unsupervised_2018] and [@ren_em-based_2019] the user selection sub-problem in NOMA schemes is tackled through an unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm and the power allocation is addressed through conventional optimization. In [@fan_d2d_2017] two Power Control (PC) algorithms based on supervised and unsupervised learning were proposed in Device-to-Device (D2D) scenarios. The authors proved the importance of ML in D2D communication by comparing two ML algorithms with conventional PC methods in terms of computational complexity, throughput, and energy efficiency. The proposed unsupervised learning approaches in all cases exhibit quite satisfactory results of optimizing resource allocation and power control, thus making them applicable to 6G applications in the previously mentioned network challenges.

Modulation recognition aims to identify modulation types of the received signals. Conventional approaches include several procedures such as preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Author in [@rajendran_deep_2018], [@west_deep_2017] investigated the performance of different unsupervised algorithms including CNN, LSTM and on modulation recognition and automatic classification. The comparison results suggest that LSTM can achieve better performance than other DL based approaches. 

Fault management includes detection, prediction, diagnosis, and mitigation of abnormal status of networks. Efficient fault management is more challenging in 6G networks, due their heterogeneous, complex, and dynamic nature. SOM appeared to outperform Fuzzy C-means and K-means in detecting and predicting abnormalities in 6G networks in study comparing several candidate algorithms. Authors in [@hashmi_enabling_2017] investigated the performance of five different unsupervised learning algorithms (K-means clustering, Fuzzy C-means clustering, Local Outlier Factor- LOF, Local Outlier Probabilities- LoOP and Kohonen’s Self Organizing Maps-SOM) on detecting faults in the networks. The results reveal that SOM outperforms Fuzzy C-means and K-means in detecting and predicting abnormalities in 6G networks. Figure \@ref(fig:som) displays an example of a SOM in unsupervised learning.  In [@ding_application_2016] a malware detection system using Deep Belief Network (DBN) outperformed widely used ML techniques such as SVM, KNN, achieving an accuracy of up to 96%. In [@mohamed_inter-disciplinary_2020] an extension of the conventional K-Mean clustering algorithm is developed to deal with fault detection. The unsupervised learning algorithm, named K-Aware K-means, can self-optimize the $K$ value ($K \leq 1$). This unsupervised learning phase acquires a temporary expert knowledge of what the minority of the current data (the smallest cluster) is like and labels them as outliers. Once a new type of fault is validated by the system, the database expert knowledge is renewed and updated. In the fault prediction sub-model, a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural network (DNN) is proposed to perform online fault prediction. The proposed LSTM-DNN is achieved a prediction accuracy of 99.7%. The authors [@gomez-andrades_automatic_2015] in  propose a SOM for fault analysis and recovery, achieving great results in terms of accuracy.

With the emergence of 6G scenarios (e.g. molecular communications) and new technologies (e.g. UM-MIMO, mmWave, THz communication), future radio communication channels are becoming more complex. Therefore, it is more challenging to efficiently estimate the channel status [@zhang_towards_2020]. Unsupervised learning models (DL model, CNN and RNN) have been used for channel detection in molecular communication [@samuel_deep_2017], [@farsad_detection_2017]. A DL-based detector called DetNet suggested in [@samuel_deep_2017] achieves similar accuracy as conventional algorithms with much lower computation time. The DL-based detectors suggested in [@farsad_detection_2017] outperform the conventional detector. Especially, the LSTM-based detector (Figure \@ref(fig:lstm)) shows an outstanding performance in the molecular communication scenarios even with intersymbol interference [@liu_real-time_2020].

Mobility management for 6G is very challenging because 6G networks will be super heterogeneous, multi-layer, large-dimensional, and highly dynamic. To ensure user experience, improve resource utilization, and reduce the signaling overhead of networks, intelligent mobility management by learning and predicting user’s movement and optimizing handover parameters is of great importance [@zhang_towards_2020]. Authors in [@mohamed_mobility_2015] used a discrete-time Markov chain algorithm to learn the mobility model of users and then make predictions of the next cell the user is most likely to move into. Results show that the solution can effectively predict the user’s trajectory, with accuracy depending on the confidence parameter. Also, in [@si_mobility_2010] authors modeled the mobile network as a state-transition graph and formulated the problem by using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to make predictions about user location, with the results verified the efficiency and accuracy of the HMM-based method. Authors in [@hassan_user_2020], in order to find the user association in a coexisting RF/THz network propose two user equipment (UE) association algorithms based on unsupervised learning, which capture the network heterogeneity observed at RF and THz frequencies. The proposed algorithms identify the appropriate UEs to be associated to a certain BS such that the overall network load standard deviation (STD) can be minimized subject to rate constraints. The proposed algorithms outperformed the classical ones in terms of data rate, traffic load balancing, and user’s fairness.

AI/ML technologies can also be considered in applications of authentication and access control to analyze and detect different kinds of attacks, such as spoofing, jamming, denial of service (DoS) or distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, eavesdropping, malware attacks and many others. Unsupervised learning can investigate unlabeled data dividing them into different groups; For example, multivariate correlation analysis can help to detect DoS and DDoS attacks. Also, nonparametric Bayesian methods, can be introduced in proximity-based authentication and access control to identify the IoT devices in the proximity without leaking the localization and other privacy-sensitive information [@xiao_iot_2018]. To address the security issue, authors in [@chen_deep_2019] propose a DRL based approach that detects various attacking possibilities through unsupervised learning. Results showed that the proposed technique attains a 6 percent extra gain in accuracy.

ML-based decoders have been proposed since the 1990 for channel decoding applications, because they do not rely on expert knowledge and the process is fast and simple. In [@nachmani_rnn_2017], a Belief Propagation (BP) decoder based on RNN is proposed by feeding the output of parity layers into the input of variable layers and unifying the weight parameters in each iteration. The results indicate that the BP-RNN decoder outperforms a plain BP decoder. Authors in [@gruber_deep_2017] developed a decoder based plain DNN architecture to decode code-words of length N with K information bits, able to work for  16-bit length polar codes and achieves maximum posteriori performance. Authors in [@cammerer_scaling_2017] suggested that employing DL based decoding methods can improve the performance of polar codes, by replacing sub-blocks of the decoder with Neural Network (NN) based components. Their suggested approach enables a high level of parallelization and shows a competitive bit error rate (BER) performance. 

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication networks is an emerging paradigm in the B5G wireless networks to support high transmission rates, to provide ubiquitous connectivity to a diverse set of end-users, and to facilitate wireless broadcast [@maraqa_survey_2020]. A typical use-case studied in UAV-NOMA systems is when the UAV acts as a flying BS and provides a capacity boost to an existing terrestrial network. In [@liu_uav_2019] a K-means clustering algorithm is used to find an initial clustering of spatially correlated users after which a Q-learning algorithm (RL algorithm) is used for the 3-D placement of the UAV BS. In [@munaye_uav_2019] authors proposed utilization of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and long short term memory (LSTM) techniques to predict optimal UAV location to enhance user throughput and system performance. The proposed approach offers an accurate UAV position and enhances user throughput. Also, in [@huang_unsupervised_2018] the authors suggested a DRL based techniques as a solution to model the traffic flow, with the efficiency of the approach surpassing existing techniques.

With multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) has been widely adopted in wireless systems. Authors in [@huang_unsupervised_2018] propose a fast beamforming design method for the sum-rate maximization in a Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output single base station system using unsupervised learning. The proposed model improves computational speed significantly with performance close to optimal used algorithms.

Visible light communications (VLC) has recently emerged as a potential technology for complementing and/or offloading radio frequency (RF) communications systems for various indoor user-dense scenarios such as homes, office rooms, conference and exhibition halls, airplanes and train cabins as well as some outdoor and V2X applications in 5G and 6G networks. VLC is based on the principle of modulating light emitted by diodes (LEDs), without any adverse effects on the human eye and the required illumination levels, which gives an opportunity to exploit the existing illumination infrastructure for wireless communication purposes. VLC technology is expected to play an important role in enabling very high data-rate short-range communications as well as V2V and in general V2X applications in B5G networks [@maraqa_survey_2020].In [@chi_visible_2020] some clustering-based unsupervised machine learning techniques (K-means and clustering algorithm perception decision-CAPD)) have been applied to mitigate nonlinearity in VLC systems. In 2017, CAPD was applied in a multiband CAP VLC system with a Q-factor improvement of 1.6–2.5 dB. A K-means-based pre-distorter was proposed in 2018, and at least 50% performance improvement was achieved using this scheme [@chi_visible_2020].
